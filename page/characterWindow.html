      <h2>Hadeon's Character Bio</h2>
      <p class='emphasis'>Jaren Calder</p>
      <p><span class="emphasis">Notes:</span>Born into a low noble family in the far-off lands of Meridia, Jaren has recently left his homeland for The Rite. Well-read and an imposing figure, most seemed to have little doubt that he would return with grand tales and a prestigious weight to his name. However Jaren has long carried a secret which has caused an almost bestial nature to grow buried within him.</p><p>Jaren carries himself with an air of grace and calm, though there's a certain weariness that lurks behind his eyes. In his Rite he's travelled through the many lands of The Empire, and briefly joined a band of sellswords headed to The Fourth Crusade before seeing what sickening men he had in his company. When the sellswords began to extort and harass a local village they were passing through, Jaren stood up to them. He managed to escape with his life, though found himself alone in a desert he didn't know. He was then found by a slave caravan, which sold him to the Dune Tribes of Ajana.</p>
      <p><span class="emphasis">Traits:</span>Jaren stands at 6'3 and weighs in at 205 pounds. He is surprisingly fast and agile for his size, and in the heat of battle fights with almost feral ferocity. He had kept his black hair short and cropped, though recently it has grown out to his shoulders. He has ocean-blue eyes and has rather tanned skin for a northerner. Now in the Dune Tribe arena, he's begun to sport a short beard as well. Jaren has a tattoo band around his right bicep with sigils from his family crest.</p>

      <p>Such and such backstory from this region with this history and this is what his objective is going forward. Blah blah blah.</p>
