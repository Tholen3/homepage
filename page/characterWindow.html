      <h2>Hadeon's Character Bio</h2>
      <p class='accordion' data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#jaren">Jaren Calder</p>
      <div id="jaren" class="collapse">
      <p><span class="emphasis">Notes:</span>Jaren was born into one of the smaller noble houses of Meridia. The middle child of three, he both felt the responsibility of guiding his younger brother, and the weight of following in his elder brother's footsteps. Throughout his youth their mother made a point to raise them with academic minds, having them read through the entire family library by the time they were old enough to step foot on a battlefield.</p><p>Meanwhile, their father would take them hunting and taught them to survive in the wilds. By their mid teens they had seen their first battle, and by the time they were approaching adulthood they were all well-versed in combat. However, Jaren's life was greatly disrupted in his late teens when his older brother was exiled from Meridia. While Jaren respected the laws of the land, he struggled with the fact that his brother could no longer set foot in their childhood home.</p><p>By the time Jaren left for The Rite, there was a weariness hidden behind his eyes. Between dark secrets kept, the weight of their family name on his shoulders, and things left untold, there was an almost animalistic nature buried inside him yearning for strife. First he travelled to the Pellantine capital, where he met with a Meridian emissary and was assigned to travel to the far east as an Imperial agent. When he arrived in the east and accomplished his task, he joined a company of sellswords travelling to Ajana with the goal of joining the Fourth Crusade. However, on the journey he soon witnessed the twisted natures of those in his company. One night he found the sellswords exploiting and harassing the locals of a small town they were passing through, and Jaren couldn't help but stand up to them. He escaped with his life, but wound up lost in the desert alone. It didn't take long for him to be found by slave traders, who then sold him to the dune tribes to take part in their arena combat.</p>
      <p><span class="emphasis">Character Traits:</span>While he looks rather rugged, there's a certain air of subdued nobility to him. He's a man of few words, though tends to speak his mind with little filter when he does speak. Much like most Meridian knights, he has a certain sense of honor and the urge to live a story worth retelling, but he understands that life is grey rather than black-and-white. Thus, he has little moral hesitation breaking laws when necessary for survival or to do what he feels is needed. Few seem to read him very well, though those that can find that there's a hidden darkness within him; a buried ferocity.</p>
      <p><span class="emphasis">Physical Traits:</span>Jaren stands at 6'3 and weighs in at 205 pounds. He is surprisingly fast and agile for his size, and in the heat of battle fights with almost feral ferocity. He had kept his black hair short and cropped, though recently it has grown out to his shoulders. He has ocean-blue eyes and has rather tanned skin for a northerner. Now in the Dune Tribe arena, he's begun to sport a short beard as well. Jaren has a tattoo band around his right bicep with sigils from his family crest.</p>
